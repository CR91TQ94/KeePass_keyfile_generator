# KeePass Python keyfile generator (memorable)

This script is a KeePass keyfile generator, which allows you to create a secure keyfile using a memorable brain-key. KeePass is a widely-used password manager that enhances security by requiring a keyfile in addition to a master password. These scripts take a user-provided brain-key, compute a hash, and then processes this hash to create a SHA-256 hash. The result is formatted into an XML document that serves as the KeePass keyfile.

### Three types of hashing: 
These scripts offer three distinct methods for processing your brain-key: standard SHA-256, Keccak-512, and SHAKE-256 with a variable output length. You may select the type that best suits your needs. The SHAKE algorithm provides the flexibility to choose the output length according to your preference.

### How It Works:

1.  **Brain-Key Input**: The script takes a memorable brain-key input (e.g., "password").
2.  **Three hashing types**: It calculates the hash of the input and stores it as SHA-2 (256), or Keccak (512), or Shake (256/variable)
-   a) **SHA2_KeePass_keyfile.py**: It calculates the SHA-2/256 hash of the input and stores it.
-   b) **KECCAK_KeePass_keyfile.py**: It calculates the Keccak/512 hash of the input and stores it.
-   c) **SHAKE_KeePass_keyfile.py**: It calculates the SHAKE(-256) hash of the input with a free output length (example of 111 / 222 hex) and stores it.
3.  **Raw Conversion**: The hash is converted from HEX to raw bytes.
4.  **SHA-256 Hash**: The script then computes the SHA-256 hash of the raw bytes and extracts the first 8 characters.
5.  **XML Keyfile Creation**: An XML document is generated, embedding both hashes, and saved as a `.keyx` file.

### Security Warning:

Using this method to generate KeePass keyfiles can be very dangerous if not used properly. The security of your keyfile relies heavily on the secrecy and strength of your brain-key. If the brain-key is weak or easily guessable, it could lead to someone breaking your keys and gaining unauthorized access to your KeePass database. Always use a strong, unique brain-key and handle the generated keyfile with extreme caution.

The script is designed to make it easy to create a secure keyfile for KeePass, but it must be used responsibly to ensure your data remains protected.
