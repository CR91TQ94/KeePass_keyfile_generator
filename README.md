# KeePass Python keyfile generator (memorable)

This script is a KeePass keyfile generator, which allows you to create a secure keyfile using a memorable brain-key. KeePass is a widely-used password manager that enhances security by requiring a keyfile in addition to a master password. This script takes a user-provided brain-key, computes a Keccak-512 hash, and then processes this hash to create a SHA-256 hash. The result is formatted into an XML document that serves as the KeePass keyfile.

### How It Works:

1.  **Brain-Key Input**: The script takes a memorable brain-key input (e.g., "abcd").
2.  **Keccak-512 Hash**: It calculates the Keccak-512 hash of the input and stores it.
3.  **Raw Conversion**: The Keccak-512 hash is converted from HEX to raw bytes.
4.  **SHA-256 Hash**: The script then computes the SHA-256 hash of the raw bytes and extracts the first 8 characters.
5.  **XML Keyfile Creation**: An XML document is generated, embedding both hashes, and saved as a `.keyx` file.

### Security Warning:

Using this method to generate KeePass keyfiles can be very dangerous if not used properly. The security of your keyfile relies heavily on the secrecy and strength of your brain-key. If the brain-key is weak or easily guessable, it could lead to someone breaking your keys and gaining unauthorized access to your KeePass database. Always use a strong, unique brain-key and handle the generated keyfile with extreme caution.

The script is designed to make it easy to create a secure keyfile for KeePass, but it must be used responsibly to ensure your data remains protected.
